                     <h3>More about "Pan de muerto"</h3>
                     <p>
                        "The origin of the Pan de Muerto dates back to the 
                        time of the Conquest, which was inspired by pre-Hispanic rituals when human sacrifices 
                        were practiced and which today is one of the major representatives of the Day of the Dead 
                        The creation of this bread was due to the fact that the Spanish found this practice very violent, 
                        so they suggested preparing a wheat bread covered with red sugar, which simulated the hearts of the 
                        maidens without reaching the extremes of taking their lives away.
                        It is known that in Mesoamerica a ground amaranth bread was prepared that, after mixing with the blood 
                        of the sacrifices, was offered to the gods, these being the first signs of the Bread of the Dead, 
                        which has been modified until it becomes what we know today, and has also become one 
                        of the most important components of the offerings.
                        <br>
                        What does it represent?
                        <br>
                        The circle in the center symbolizes the skull of the deceased and the raised strips that are covered around 
                        it are the imitation of the bones that make up the human body; in some cases orange blossom essence is added, 
                        which evokes the memory of the deceased."
                        Perhaps too creepy but yet delicious!
