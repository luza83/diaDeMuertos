                    "Día de los Muertos, or Day of the Dead, is not a Mexican version of Halloween.

                    Though related, the two annual events differ greatly in traditions and tone. 
                    Whereas Halloween is a dark night of terror and mischief, 
                    Day of the Dead festivities unfold over two days in an explosion of color and life-affirming joy. 
                    Sure, the theme is death, but the point is to demonstrate love and respect for deceased family members. 
                    In towns and cities throughout Mexico, revelers don funky makeup and costumes, 
                    hold parades and parties, sing and dance, and make offerings to lost loved ones. 

                    Day of the Dead originated several thousand years ago with the Aztec, Toltec, 
                    and other Nahua people, who considered mourning the dead disrespectful. 
                    For these pre-Hispanic cultures, death was a natural phase in life’s long continuum. 
                    The dead were still members of the community, kept alive in memory and spirit—and during Día de los Muertos, 
                    they temporarily returned to Earth. 
                    Today’s Día de los Muertos celebration is a mash-up of pre-Hispanic religious rites and Christian feasts. 
                    It takes place on November 1 and 2—All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day on the Catholic calendar—around 
                    the time of the fall maize harvest."

                    The day of the dead is an extraordinarily complex celebration that illustrates the fusion between cultures, 
                    the ancient Mexican culture, and the Spanish culture, which brought religion and different beliefs during the conquest. 
                    Traditions are kept since ancient times and they are practiced every year by people who truly 
                    believe in the return of their beloved ones that have passed away.

                        It is believed that during 3 days by the end of October, people who has died and who is in the dead world, 
                        has the opportunity to visit their families who are still alive. 
                        In order for this to happen the family members who are alive start a ritual or celebration that lasts three days in which, 
                        altars are build, food is prepared and the path to home is built.
                        <br>
                        “On October 31, All Hallows Eve, the children make a children's altar to invite the angelitos (spirits of dead children) 
                        to come back for a visit. November 1 is All Saints Day, and the adult spirits will come to visit. 
                        November 2 is All Souls Day, when families go to the cemetery to decorate the graves and tombs of their relatives. 
                        The three-day fiesta is filled with marigolds, the flowers of the dead; muertos (the bread of the dead); sugar skulls; 
                        cardboard skeletons; tissue paper decorations; fruit and nuts; incense, and other traditional foods and decorations.”
